h1. Rtorrent on rails

Experimental rails application for controlling the ever popular rtorrent.

h2. Installation

* Copy the example config file config.yml.example to config.xml
* Configure the path to your scgi enabled rtorrent location within the config
* Set any other variables as you wish in the config

h2. Usage

In the current directory, run:
<pre><code>
script/server
</code></pre>

to start the internal rails web server.

Now visit http://0.0.0.0:3000 and hopefully view your torrents!

Check out capistrano for managing this remotely.

h2. Notes

Total rails newb, I'm pretty sure this entire application could be reduced to a
one liner. Watch out for rtorrent not being able to read the socket due to a
permissions issue.
