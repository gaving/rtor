h1. Rtorrent on rails TODO list

h2. 0.2+

* [_] View torrent information
* [_] Draggable/collapsable panels at the bottom
* [_] Make separate views for the seeding and the downloading
* [_] Admin interface
* [_] Prowl would be good. Though, I'm thinking a standalone DBUS enabled app
might be better for the notification stuff.

h2. 0.1

* [/] Drag and drop torrents on to main div to download (impossible?)
* [x] Heartbeat and timeout stuff for abandoning the constant refreshes
* [x] Get the torrents feed working
* [x] Make the download box actually do something
* [x] Interface it with Growl for torrent events (Since removed)
* [_] Configuration, both at the backend and frontend
* [x] Use the multicall RPC method instead of the brain dead way of doing it now
* [_] Fix the sorting. Move back to sorttable.js?
* [_] Context sensitive menu items
* [_] Make open action work
* [_] Update the header on an operation
